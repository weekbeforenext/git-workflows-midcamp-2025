# The Midnight Library Adventure

You discover a hidden door in your local library that leads to a magical world...

As you step through the doorway, the shelves around you stretch into the sky, filled with glowing books that whisper your name. A friendly owl wearing spectacles greets you and offers to be your guide through the enchanted aisles.
