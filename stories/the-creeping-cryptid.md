# The Creeping Cryptid
"Surprise!" They cried, leaping out from behind the door...

I had no clue what to look at first: their dozens of glowing eyes, their flowing-yet-matted hair, or their uncanny bipedal walking. This insectoid is in my home, the one place where I am supposed to feel safe, and it's _talking_. I don't care if this is _Mothman_ or a giant mosquito from a secret labâ€”I am not letting this ruin my first day at school.
