# My best friend is a dragon
People say that dragons arenâ€™t real, but I know better...

The other day, while I was on a run through the woods, I heard the loudest screech coming from behind me. When I turned around, I couldn't believe what I saw!

It was a small youngish aged turtle, slightly mutated, eating pizza. Not the typcial pizza you normally see turtles eat, but pizza with pinapple on it. Oh the humanity!

The dragon described above is super cool and powerful!
