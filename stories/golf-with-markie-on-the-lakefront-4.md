# Golf with Markie at Waveland Golf Course
## Waveland Golf Course aka Sidney Marovitz Golf Course
### Waveland is part of the Chicago Park District and is on the shores of Lake Michigan on the near north side of Chicago. 

Markie is a Drupal friend from Albuquerque. He also plays golf. We're both attending MidCamp.
A fun social event is to play this course together during MidCamp.
